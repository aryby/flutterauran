# Flutter SQLite App

This project is a **Flutter application** that integrates **SQLite** for local data storage. It demonstrates how to implement a local database for storing, retrieving, and managing data within a mobile app. The app uses **Flutter** as the front-end framework and **SQLite** as the back-end database, providing an efficient and lightweight solution for handling offline data persistence.

## Features

- **Local Storage**: Store data locally on the device using SQLite, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the SQLite database.
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient SQLite queries for fast data access.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface developed with Flutter.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both Android and iOS devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building native mobile apps.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database for local storage.
- **Dart**: The programming language used with Flutter.
